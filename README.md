# slidingpuzzle

• Developed a Sliding Puzzle game which incorporates a user interface, using PyQt5 and QWidgets.

• The user can change the difficulty of the game to a puzzle of 3x3, 4x4 or 5x5 dimension.

• Used NumPy for the mechanics of the game, making it possible for the values of the tiles to change when interacting with the tiles.
